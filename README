This simple python scripts helps you to make reports for EU accounting from Android Market reports. What it can do:

- count with VAT and without VAT sales for every app
- count, how much you should pay for VAT
- works with conversion rates provided by google in report, convert everything to your main Google Checkout currency

Output is in CSV, written to standard output. Has some fragments from older version, so that not everything is used :-) (will clean up it later).

Configuration:

- open config.py and add your apps there. It is simple AndroidMarket bundle id / your app name key value hash.

Run the reporter.py script with one parameter - CSV file downloaded from Android Market sales reports.

NOTE - for each app, there are 2 rows - one for sales in countries with VAT, and second in countries WITHOUT VAT.

Tested on German Google Checout account, with TAXes set to EU VAT taxes and rest of the word set "no taxes".
